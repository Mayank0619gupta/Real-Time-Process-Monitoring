# Real time process monitoring

## Description

A program under execution, including its code, ongoing operations, and the system resources it uses (such as CPU, memory, and input/output), is referred to as a "process" in an operating system (OS). In order to guarantee effective system performance, identify irregularities, and resolve problems, real-time process monitoring entails watching and evaluating these processes as they run with the least amount of delay.

For this purpose, a dashboard is a graphical interface that compiles and displays important process-related metrics, allowing users, developers, or system administrators to make well-informed decisions fast.

## Key Features

1.Performance tracking: Keep an eye on process network activity, disk I/O, memory utilization, and CPU usage. </br>
2.Resource Management: To maximize system efficiency, identify procedures that use a lot of resources. </br>
3.Identify anomalous activity, such as crashes, memory leaks, or rogue programs, using anomaly detection. </br>
4.User Interaction: Offer an easy-to-use interface for viewing and controlling processes (e.g., prioritize, terminate). </br>
5.Scalability: Enable real-time monitoring across one or more systems. </br>

## Applications

System administration: Keep an eye on workstations or servers to adjust performance. </br>
Development: Monitor the behavior of processes to debug applications. </br>
Education: Explain OS ideas such as resource allocation and process scheduling. </br>

## Limitations

Latency: Making sure that changes happen "real-time" and without any lag. </br>
Scalability: The ability of a busy system to manage hundreds or thousands of processes. </br>
Accuracy: Taking OS-level caching and reporting metric delays into account. </br>
Adapting to various OS architectures, such as 32-bit versus 64-bit, is known as portability. </br>
